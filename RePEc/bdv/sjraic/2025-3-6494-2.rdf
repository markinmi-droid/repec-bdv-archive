Abstract: This article examines the role of startup ecosystems in shaping the innovative competitiveness of a national economy, using Sweden and Estonia as case studies. The analysis focuses on the key elements of successful ecosystems, including the institutional environment, access to finance, human capital development, and the level of digitalization. Particular attention is paid to a comparative analysis of two distinct models: the Swedish model, characterized by a complex, multi-layered architecture integrating the state, universities, and large corporations, and the Estonian model, which is oriented towards the digitalization of administrative infrastructure and the creation of an open global ecosystem. The positive effects of developing startup ecosystems are considered, such as inbound investment flows, an increase in the number of high-tech companies, and improved national standings in global competitiveness rankings. The relevance of the topic is driven by the growing importance of innovation as a key factor for economic growth and resilience in the context of global competition. The aim of this research is to identify the relationship between the development of startup ecosystems and the level of national competitiveness, as well as to determine key trends, barriers, and prospects for countries with emerging innovation ecosystems. The research logic is as follows: first, the conceptual framework and theoretical foundations of innovative competitiveness and startup ecosystems are outlined; subsequently, a detailed comparative analysis of the Swedish and Estonian models is conducted, employing statistical data and correlation analysis to identify key success factors. The study is based on comparative, statistical, and analytical methods, as well as on the analysis of contemporary scientific publications and reports from international organizations. Based on the analysis, it is concluded that the competitiveness of a national innovation economy is determined by the efficacy of administrative institutions and the degree of digitalization. The findings of this research can be utilized for developing small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) growth strategies in other countries.
