Abstract: The increasing competition in the labour market emerged the problem of graduates' adaptation. The education system helps to live and work effectively in a rapidly changing world. Nowadays, the major purpose of education is personal, social, and professional competences. Indeed, the ability of the graduates to analyse and effectively use information is one of the most demanded. Therefore, an independent work of the students takes a significant place in the curricula of higher education institutions. However, to be competitive in the labour market is the one urgent task of the modern education. The purpose of this study is to determine empirically the effectiveness of portfolio technology for personal branding development in terms of competitiveness. Indeed, the process of personal branding development is relevant since the employment of graduates is included in the university's accreditation indicators. Despite the portfolio technology has been introduced into the higher education system, according to our research, it does not achieve its goals. The reason is the formal and unjustified attitude of the education system towards the technology. However, our research shows a high ranking of motivation to master self-presentation skills, professional career, etc. Therefore, there is a need to address this contradiction through the effective management. The sociological survey method allows us to describe the process under study and identify the difference between educational institutions. Indeed, the skill of personal portfolio development depends on the objectives of the educational process at the university. Moreover, many students are not informed about the portfolio technology. We possess it a result of insufficient management in terms of personal brand development. In general, according to research results, mastering of portfolio technology as a tool for personal branding and competitiveness is quite poor.
