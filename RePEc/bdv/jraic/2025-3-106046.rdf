Abstract: Vietnam is one of the leading countries in Southeast Asia in the digital transformation process and is among the developing countries that face both opportunities and challenges associated with this change. This research examines Vietnam's digital transformation owing to the country's quick adoption of new technologies and the pressing requirement to solve related structural limitations. Key prospects are examined, including innovation-driven development and global market integration, while facing issues including the digital divide, cybersecurity flaws, and possible economic displacement. This study uses a mixed-method approach, analyzing qualitative information from case studies and policy evaluations in addition to quantitative data from national and international official sources. The results highlight Vietnam's capacity to use digital transformation for sustainable and equitable growth while pointing out important areas that need attention. Creating strong digital regulations, encouraging collaborations between the public and business sectors, and expanding digital literacy initiatives are some examples of practical suggestions.
